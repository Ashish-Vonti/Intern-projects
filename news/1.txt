The launch of a U.S. spy satellite atop a powerful Delta IV Heavy rocket was called off in the final seconds late last night (Sept. 30), mirroring the outcome of an attempt a month ago.
The Delta IV Heavy, which is built by the United Launch Alliance (ULA), was scheduled to loft the clandestine NROL-44 satellite at 11:54 p.m. EDT last night (0354 GMT on Oct. 1) from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Seven seconds before the planned launch, however, the countdown came to a halt.
